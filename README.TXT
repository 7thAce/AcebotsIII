This is Acebots III written by 7thAce, a Twitch.tv moderation and utiliy bot.
Currently, the bot is not finished yet and is not available for download.  Expected completion is end of June 2014, although I am trying to get it done by June 20th (no promises!).

Why Acebots?
Acebots is highly customizable, more so than most other popular bots on twitch, such as Nightbot, Moobot, or Xanbot.
This is because Acebots is a downloadable application instead of a twitch addon.
Acebots also features a built in plugin system, allowing users to create their own commands, systems, and features.
At the current time, Acebots is also a relatively small bot (in terms of userbase), so I am able to respond to support and requests easier.
Finally, I try and make Acebots unique.  By making assumptions about chat and applying those in clever ways, Acebots can appear much "smarter" than other bots.

Development Changelog (if I remember to update this):
June 5 - Created the dynamic priority queue for sending messages.
         Implemented a similar access system to Acebots II for easier coding and useability by current streamers and mods.
         
June 4 - Got our first response back from a command!
         Changed constructors on commands to include a BotCore argument, and adjusted the classloaders as necessary.
