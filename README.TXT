This is Acebots III written by 7thAce, a Twitch.tv moderation and utiliy bot.
Currently, the .jar file is in the works and should be out very soon! (for real!)

Why Acebots?
Acebots is highly customizable, more so than most other popular bots on twitch, such as Nightbot, Moobot, or Xanbot.
This is because Acebots is a downloadable application instead of a twitch addon.
Acebots also features a built in plugin system, allowing users to create their own commands, systems, and features.
At the current time, Acebots is also a relatively small bot (in terms of userbase), so I am able to respond to support and requests easier.
Finally, I try and make Acebots unique.  By making assumptions about chat and applying those in clever ways, Acebots can appear much "smarter" than other bots.

COMING SOON TRUST ME <3

Known issues:
Viewer count at the top is wrong over time.
Tracking some issues with the Updated Stram Title not pulling properly.
Reconnect code just flat out doesn't work.
The whole right pane is not used.  Consider removing or repurposing (user list causes a lot of issues)

Updates coming:
Fixing of above bugs
WR auto-updating (wrlink class) from Speedrun.com for games
Some other stuff I haven't thought of in the last 3 minutes
